# Git_Tutorial
This is a guide to learning Git and GitHub which covers topics beginning from understanding Git and then using Git to create and manage code inside GitHub.

## What is Git?
In Google Docs, once we make a certain change and we want to go back to a previous change that we made, Docs offers us a feature in which we can see the version history of our file which saves all the changes that we have made to our file.

In a similar fashion, Git is the code analog of Google Docs which can be used to track changes in code, track who made those changes, collaborate together on open-source projects etc. So Git is a version control system which was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 and has been maintained by Junio Hamano since then.
